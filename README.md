Based on the [eBookApp - Flutter UI](https://github.com/abuanwar072/eBook_app_Flutter) 
 this is a simple wrap to that UI that will allow you to Download and Read books.

## Getting Started
1. `_JSON_ASSETS/` include sample json and epubs that are parsed and used in the App.
2. `_JSON_ASSETS/` upload the files to a webserver.
3. In `lib/utils/const.dart` update the `appAPIURL =` to your webserver path.
